In my thesis, I combine writing from a non-human perspective (desire) with more of an essayist approach to express my personal thoughts. I also make reference to a few academic standpoints that I borrowed from the book “Norms of Visibility. Identity in Times of Transition” by Polish scholar Magda Szczesniak, whose opinions built my theoretical framework and enriched my research on visual culture studies on Polish socio-political transformation. I will reflect further upon my research by analysing wedding garments such as bridal accessories, dresses, veils and gloves I retrieved from my parents’ store. Through these materials, I wish to create a metaphorical image of the Polish desire for commercialism, which can be viewed as a contract  amongst three parties: capitalism, Polish authorities and the Catholic Church. The words of the oath emerged as such:<br><br><i>“In the name of God, I, Poland, take you, Capitalism, to be my husband, as long as we both shall live.”</i>" },

Many of you try to embrace me rationally, tame my temper, capture my nature in philosophical treatises. You develop deep emotions about me, and you are not even aware of them. Humans can perceive me differently which is sometimes quite confusing to me. For instance, ancient thinkers identified me as philosophical problem and the highest state of human nature. I am deeply flattered. On the other hand, Buddhists believe that craving me is the cause of all suffering. Their teachings suggest that by eliminating me, a person can attain ultimate happiness, or, as they call it, Nirvana. Western philosophers have also fiercely debated about me. Immanuel Kant, for instance, who argued that I am the agitation of the soul, the projection located in the future. And, because I am currently not fulfilled and absent in your life, anticipation of my future oncoming brings you pleasant thoughts. I must admit that I am impressed by all of their findings and how all of them are somehow right about how I actually think about myself. I bridge the promise of pleasure with the bitterness of anticipation. I am suspended in between two realities, arriving from the future but sitting next to you here and now. " },

You find yourself standing in front of Pewex, a chain of shops founded during the communist era in Poland that accepted payment only in United States dollars and other hard currencies, instead of the country's indigenous currency, the Złoty. You are staring at a shop display filled with items not available for purchase on the normal market while wearing an old pair of jeans and a wool sweater knitted by your mother. Your older brother grew out of these trousers and you were the next in line to wear them. The old ketchup stain your mother did not get rid of does not make it easier for you. In the times of food shortages and no consumer market in communist Poland each object, clothing or good, was worth its weight in gold.

The lure of American dollars was very strong in Poland. Shopping at Pewex at the time was seen as a rather exclusive affair, due to the high cost of its items when compared to the average salary at the time. This turned Pewex into a symbol of luxury and privilege. Once again, you are in Poland in times when the country is experiencing a major shift from centrally planned economy to the new, neoliberal phase. In your fantasies you see yourself standing on the wedding rug, ready to swear unconditional love to the new system, but during communist times your dreamed marriage is, unfortunately, still a forbidden fruit, but you wish for the better future." },

These commercial slogans were printed in the first Polish lifestyle journal <i>Ty i Ja</i> (“You and Me”). This magazine, published in the 60s and 70s, was shut down under censorship laws. It was found to be arousing unnecessary longings and desires which, given the economic situation, the state was not able to provide. The magazine promoted a modern, Western lifestyle and was composed of fashion, film and interior design sections and the communist state found itself threatened by this ‘westernisation’. In fact, <i>Ty i Ja</i> regularly plagiarised the content of western magazines directly, but there seemed to be a ‘quiet consent’ for this practice from the western press." },

Therefore, it was not so much an advertisement of specific goods, but rather a certain representation of the idea of “modernity”.

For western readers, the world presented in Perec's novel was accessible, it was behind the glass of a display window. For Polish readers, the world presented in <i>Ty i Ja</i> magazine was a kind of utopia, a vision of a better, beautiful and modern reality promoting the enjoyment of ownership.

The poster presents the American actor Gary Cooper as the sheriff from the movie “High Noon” against the background of the “Solidarity” inscription and with the “Solidarity” badge affixed to the lapel, above the sheriff's star. The promise of overthrowing the communist regime was carried out by Lech Walesa, a laid-off electrician, and other workers who had barricaded themselves inside Lenin’s Shipyard to protest against the Communist Party.

When you say your praises tonight, what will you ask for your country?” the American TV presenter asked Lech Walesa in 1989. Poland was central to the historic changes that took place across Eastern Europe at the end of the Cold War. It was the largest economy in the region, and was at the forefront of opposition to communism. “We eat the same bread” shouted Walesa to other co-protesters. It was a reference to the powerful role that Catholicism played in the trade union. Any form of religious organisation was frowned upon and resisted by the Communist Party, therefore, the opposition wore their faith as a badge of courage. In fact, most Polish people associated religious activity or participation in Church services as form of resistance. " },

He became associated with the opposition Solidarity's trade union and after his murder, by three agents of the Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, he was recognised as a martyr by the Catholic Church. Throughout the years of communist occupation, the Catholic Church was seen as a rival competing for the citizens' allegiance by the government, which attempted to suppress it. The 1978 election of Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyla as Pope John Paul II strengthened the ties of identification. John Paul's visits to Poland became rallying points for the faithful and galvanised opposition to the Soviet regime. Polish nationalists linked their struggle against communism with a struggle against atheism, which also sadly brings to mind the contemporary situation in Poland. Paradoxically, the communist regime enforced the position of the Catholic Church paving its way to becoming a major player in the political arena, the consequences of which are visible these days. Overthrowing communism was in the interest of Catholic Church who, apart from experiencing ideological persecutions, lost a lot of land and properties. This is when a mutually beneficial agreement between the spiritual authorities of the Church and the emergent neoliberal economy began to be realised; the Catholic Church has finally found its ally against the atheist ideology of communism.

The exact number of properties that have  been handed over to the Church by the Property Commission is unknown. An investigation into Polish concordat activities stated that “neither the Church side nor the Government care to provide this information”. Before World War II, the Polish Church owned around 160,000 hectares. The same amount has already been given back to the Church by the Property Commission, “but the Church claims 400,000 hectares in total”. The Church received back its properties confiscated during communism, religion was introduced in public schools and abortion was delegalised. These events took place almost 30 years ago but they correlate with the contemporary Polish reality in which politicians are strongly dependent on the opinion of the Church authorities, leading Poland to have one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. The statute on the relationship between the State and the Catholic Church, in force from 1989, is designed so that it cannot be changed without Church consent. " },

At that time, the belief that Western capitalism is the inevitable, normal and legitimate result of transition was very strong within Polish society. The logic of transformation was based on the hope that it was possible to catch up with the West. The fact that Poland was a peripheral country developing in a different way than Western countries was completely ignored. The transition to capitalism was seen as “normal” and became taken-for-granted. This process of normalisation involved the construction of an idealised norm of conduct serving almost like “staged” guidelines for Polish society. The imagination of “modern” Poles was fed by the uncritical digestion of Western video culture which had arrived with VHS equipment. Finally, the consumption of those images (spy films, melodrama, action films) became a shared identity-forming experience. These images had a crucial influence on the development of key concepts of public life such as “modernity”, “normality” or indeed, “middle class.” In line with Western ideology, they organised the imagination of their viewers, promoting certain social behaviours or lifestyles as “normal”. These images shaped the direction of change; the figures of western stock models, successful businessmen and white or black socks served as an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum social control. They enhanced the seductive language of capitalist ideology. As a result, the rhetoric of lagging behind post-soviet society who has to catch up to the West became dominant. " },

In a few scenes later, the actress actually appears in “Puma” shoes.  What does it says about people’s changing attitude towards brands and their fetishisation? Complementing the bigger picture, the largest Polish marketplace formed after 1989. It was called Jarmark Europa (“Europa Market”) and named to reinforce the conviction that we finally fully belonged to the ‘right’ part of Europe. This market (unfortunately already demolished) was famous as the place to buy a whole range of goods, most notably clothes, software, hardware and media. The 1990s was a bizarre time in Poland. After the system-wide transformation in 1989, Poles were only just starting to get used to the free market economy. Even though we did not waste any time in fulfilling our long-suppressed consumerist fantasies to the best of our financial capabilities, but the law did not catch up with the changing market quite as fast. As unbelievable as it is today, until 1994 there were virtually no intellectual property laws in Poland, which allowed the bootleg market to thrive. At bazaars, flea markets and even in regular stores, one could buy ‘legal’ bootleg clothes, music, films or video games." },

Let's take hamburgers as an example, the status of “original” hamburgers belonging to those from the McDonald's chain, while “fakes” were sold in stalls with casseroles and fries, which pretended to be American. Mr. Antek, a seller at Jarmark Europa market, was selling jeans for children, T-shirts with Mickey Mouse and polo shirts with the imprint “Dior”. 98% of his clients were Russians. The sellers were placing their goods on camp beds or tourist tables. Velour skirts with tiger stripes, angora sweaters, “Mawiny” jeans, radio tape recorders, “Otaka” and “Pawasonic” (not to be confused with “Otake” and “Panasonic”) or cologne waters could be purchased.

The purpose of a counterfeit is to pretend to be the original; perfect counterfeit is almost impossible to distinguish from the original. The identity of the counterfeit is therefore extremely shaky because it is based on not being what it really is. During the period of transition, Polish society did not develop an unique set of positive features that could constitute a common (even if conflicted) identity in the context of finding itself in the “no man's land” between ‘the Wes’t and the Soviet Union. There was really no cultural experience in common other than one based in negation, that is, being both “non-West” and “non-East”. This poorly executed transformation process corresponds with the unconvincing nature of the fake products and a lack of critical response to change.
